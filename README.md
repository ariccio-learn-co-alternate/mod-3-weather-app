# mod-3-weather-app

Our application allows the user to select a NOAA weather station via a Google Maps API and access historical weather data for the station at two levels of detail. 

The app uses a Rails backend, which has a database storing the stations and the logic needed to query the NOAA API. User input comes from a JavaScript frontend, which renders the map and displays charts in response to user queries. 

The app is currently deployed on Heroku at: https://rain-or-shine-app.herokuapp.com/. Enjoy!


TODO: make sure the add-error-handling branch properly handles errors on the backend
